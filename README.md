# Newsletter system using SQL databas
## How to use?
### Create your own SQL DB and connect it using a .env file (or just change where the values has to be changed)


# What is this
## This is a newsletter system using python and SQL as a DB
### The way it works is that upon entering an email it will be stored within the SQL DB
### And it uses a set schedule for when it will send out the emails using the smtblib library
### In python i am taking advantage of the Flask framework for the websites backend.
